<h1>Introduction</h1>
        
<p>BANSHEE is a toolkit that simplfies the task of building
constraint-based program analyses. Program analyses are widely used in
compilers and software engineering tools for discovering or verifying
specific properties of software systems, such as type safety and
opportunities for program optimization.  To use BANSHEE, the analysis
designer provides a short specification file describing the kinds of
constraints used in the analysis. From this specification, BANSHEE
builds a customized constraint resolution engine which solves those
constraints very efficiently. BANSHEE also builds a customized
interface for that engine which is easy to use.<br>
</p>
<p>BANSHEE is the successor to BANE, the Berkeley ANalysis Engine, which
can be found <a href="http://bane.cs.berkeley.edu">here</a>. <br>

<h1>Example Applications</h1>
     Here are a few of the program analyses we have built using BANSHEE.<span
 class="smallcap"></span>     
<ul>

    <li><i>Pointer Analysis</i>: We have implemented Andersen's
points-to analysis in BANSHEE, achieving orders of magnitude<i>
</i>improvement over BANE. Our implementation of Andersen's analysis
uses a C front-end derived from GCC and is therefore distributed under
the GNU General Public License.<br>

    <li><i>CFL Reachability</i>: We have implemented an API for
    solving context-free language reachability problems with
    BANSHEE. This API can be used for a large class of program
    analyses including polymorphic flow analysis, interprocedural
    dataflow analysis, and field-sensitive points-to analysis.

<h1>Download</h1>
        
<p> BANSHEE is available for download under the BSD License.  The code
has been tested under various versions of RedHat Linux and Windows
with Cygwin. The pointer analysis application, which includes a
version of David Gay's C parser, is available separately and is
released under the GNU General Public License.</p>
