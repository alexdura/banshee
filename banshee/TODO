--- Revising the directory structure ---

the goal is to realize the following layout:

banshee
  --- libcompat 
  --- dyckcfl    (builds libdyckcfl.a)
  --- andersen   (builds libandersen.a)
  --- rca        (builds librca.a)
  --- lambda     (builds liblambda.a)
  --- docs       (builds banshee.ps)
  --- engine     (builds libnsengine.a, libengine.a)
  --- codegen    (builds banshee)
  --- bin        (contains banshee)
  --- tests      (dyckcfl-test, dyckcfl-random-test, lambda-test)
  --- lib        (libraries *.a)


to accomplish this, the following changes must be made:
  
  -x- rename directory dyck-cfl to dyckcfl
  -x- move dyckcfl-test dyckcfl-random to examples
  -x- move lambda.spec to lambda
  -x- move points-to to andersen
  -x- update every makefile
    
other tasks (a wishlist)
  --- bring .cvsignore files up to date
  -x- check builds on both unix and windows/cygwin
  -x- get dyckcfl ready for release (copyrights, etc)
  --- fix dyckcfl-random
  -x- set up test suite
  --- update manual
  -x- update copyrights (year)
  -x- fix all <>-style includes to "", and remove engine/ in codegen
  -x- add semicolon to end of all DECLARE_XXXX macros  in codegen
  --- write script for banshee to run output through indent
  -x- fix etags dependencies
  -x- tests/Makefile dependencies are not right (they seem correct now)
  --- update website, move to sourceforge
  --- RELEASE
  --- dependencies aren't quite right: autogenerate header dependencies
