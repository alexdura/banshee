This directory contains a points-to analysis application based on a C
front-end written by David Gay.

To build the application, type 'make points-to' in the parent
directory. If all goes well, this will create the file parser.exe. 

parser.exe expects preprocessed code. To run the analysis on a whole
program (with multiple source files) simply list the files on the
command line. parser.exe also understands wildcards, so, e.g.,

./parser.exe path_to_preprocessed_sources/*.c

will invoke the parser on an entire directory of C files.
