This is banshee, a toolkit for constructing constraint-based program analyses.
See the user manual in docs/banshee.ps for a complete description of banshee.

This is a beta release of banshee. Although banshee has been designed to solve
many kinds of constraints, it has only been extensively tested on 
Andersen's-style points-to analysis. 

To build banshee, the following must be installed: 
 --- o'caml (see http://caml.inria.fr)
 --- gcc

You can then build banshee by typing 'make' at the command line in
this directory. 'make check' will verify your build.

Other useful make targets:

'make docs' : build just the documentation


banshee should build and run on Linux and Windows (with cygwin)






banshee is distributed under the BSD license, with the exception of
the following files:

engine/malloc.c (see file for license)
codegen/OCamlMakefile (no license)
cparser (GPL)

Note that the cparser is a separate application, no code from cparser
is linked into banshee itself.

See the COPYRIGHT file for more details.
