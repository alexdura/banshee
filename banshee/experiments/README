* Introduction

This directory contains data and scripts used to run backtracking and
persistence experiments with banshee.


* Working with CVS Repositories

** Possible Projects

For our purposes, projects should be:

-- Written entirely in C
-- Large ( 10k+ CVS commits)
-- Hosted from SourceForge

Here are some possible projects that meet these criteria:

-- Cqual
-- Gaim: instant messenger client 13k+ commits
-- Gift: file sharing protocol, 8k+ cvs commits

** Getting local copies of CVS repositories from SourceForge

Use the following URL to get a nightly CVS snapshot. Note, these are
complete copies of the CVS repositories. Replace projectname with the
appropriate string:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/projectname-cvsroot.tar.bz2

* Preprocessing Source

The cparser frontend requires source code to be
preprocessed. Acquiring preprocessed source can be somewhat tricky,
because some files may be generated (e.g. by flex, bison, or other
tools). Here we outline some approaches.

** gcc -save-temps

Compile the project as follows:

make CC="gcc -save-temps"

This will leave the preprocessed files as .i files in the source
directories. Unfortunately, it will also compile the files, which will
be too slow.

** gcc -E

This doesn't really drop into the build process as desired, as it
dumps preprocessed files to stdout.
